## 1) Installation

Using Pip:

```python
pip install SWMat
```

Download from pypi: [SWMat.tar.gz](https://pypi.org/project/SWMat/#files)

## 2) Import

```python
from SWMat.SWMat import SWMat  # Will change it soon...
```

## 3) Usage

### 3.1 Initialize class

You can initialize `SWMat` class in two ways:

    - Either you can only pass `matplotlib.pyplot` directly,

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
swm = SWMat(plt) # Will take current Axes
```

    - Or you can pass `Axes` with `matplotlib.pyplot` to beautify given `Axes`.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 4)
swm = SWMat(plt, ax=axs[0][1])
```

### 3.2 Main features of package

There are 'two' main differentiating features of this package:

    - Base beautifications are done without much hassle,

```python
swm = SWMat(plt) # And... The Base beautifications will be added.
plt.scatter(x, y)
```

![Base](images/base.png)

    - You can easily plot text on your plot using `SWMat.text`,

```python
swm = SWMat(plt) # This function will initialize your plot
plt.scatter(x, y)
swm.text(some_text, fontsize=30);  # That's all!! Don't worry there's much more you can do with it.
```

    - And there is a `highlight` parameter available with every function in `SWMat`, to help you highlight some part of plot for that particular plot type.

### 3.3 Other Functions

#### 3.3.1 Line Plot

Main parameters to look for here are: `line_labels` (Label for each line plot) and `highlight` (int or list of lines to highlight).

```python
swm = SWMat(plt)
swm.line_plot(xs, ys, line_labels=["A", "B"], highlight=0, lw=3);
```

#### 3.3.2 Hist Plot

Main parameters to look for here are: `highlight` (int orlist of index of bins to highlight).

```python
swm = SWMat(plt)
swm.hist(data, highlight=3, bins=bins);
```

![hist](images/hist.png)

```python
swm = SWMat(plt)
swm.hist(data, highlight=3, bins=bins, hide_y=True);
```

![hist2](images/hist2.png)

#### 3.3.3 Bar Plot

Main parameters to look for here are: `plot_type` (horizontal, vertical etc), `cat_labels` (labels for categories in each data vector), `data_labels` (labels for each data vector) and `highlight` (dictionary taking int or list of ints for highlighting particular data bars or given category bars).

```python
swm = SWMat(plt)
swm.bar(cats, heights, data_labels=["A", "B", "C", "D"], cat_labels=["One", "Two", "Three"], highlight={"data":1});
```

![bar](images/bar.png)

```python
swm = SWMat(plt)
swm.bar(cats, heights, data_labels=["Alpha", "Beta"],  highlight={"data":1, "cat":1},
    cat_labels=["One", "Two", "Three"], plot_type="stacked100%");
```

#### 3.3.4 Violin Plot (Dist PLot)

Main parameters to look for here are: `show` (where violin\dist plot(s) should be shown), `highlight` (dictionary taking list of tuples of starting and ending points inbetween which to highlight, with keys as index of violin plot. Actually you can plot many violin plots simultaneously.)

```python
swm = SWMat(plt)
swm.violinplot(data, show="top", highlight={"0":[(0.7, 2.3), (4.7, 6)]})
```

![violin](images/violin.png)

#### 3.3.5 Text

Main feature of text function of SWMat is that you can type in paragraphs of text without using matplotlib's plot function again and again, and that too while using HTML like attribute specification using `prop` tag. So you can configure your text as:

```python
text = "Lorem <prop fontsize='20', color='#FF7700'>ipsum dolor</prop> sit amet." # All attribute's values needs to be inside quotes (As "value" or 'value').
```

`prop` tag can take all attributes of  `fontdict` available in matplotlib.
